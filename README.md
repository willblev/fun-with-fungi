# Fun with Fungi
We are going to try to develop and document a minimalist protocol for growing edible mushroom species (such as oyster mushrooms) using recycled materials  such as biowaste from local coffee shops and craft beer breweries as the fruiting substrate. 

## Documentation
For the project documentation, the docosaurus framework is used.
### Installation
To install the documentation system, simply execute the following command.
```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
